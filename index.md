<h1>Hello and welcome to my personal website!</h1>

<img src="images/welcome.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">

> As you can see, the website is very simple, but this is by design, allowing me to focus more on the Data Science things that I really enjoy.  

On this website I will be posting different things that interest me, be it:
- My thoughts on different subjects in a blog post;
- Books and courses I have taken in the CPD (Continuous Professional Development) section;
- Share some interesting facts about me in the About section.
