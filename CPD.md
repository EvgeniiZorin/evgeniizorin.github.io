Here I would like to showcase all the resources that I have used for my **CPD (Continuous Professional Development)**. I enjoy learning new things related to my career in different ways:
- Doing online courses from websites such as Coursera, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp;
- Reading textbooks on topics in Data Science, Statistics, and Programming;
- Attending and participating in live events;

You can see all the Data Science-related books that I've read on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/145948565-evgenii-zorin?shelf=_data-science" target="_blank">Goodreads account, shelf `_data-science`.</a>

> Please note that this section is still being written, so there are many things that are not present here! 

# Machine Learning

            <td>Course<br><b>Machine Learning Specialisation</b> - DeepLearning.ai, Stanford (Coursera)</td>
            <td>This is an amazing comprehensive course that teaches both theoretical and practical aspects of building ML models. I believe that this might be the best course on ML out there and would highly recommend it!</td>

            <td><b>Essential Math for Data Science</b> - Thomas Nield (O'Reily)</td>
            <td>While not as rigorous and comprehensive as other books on Data Science, this one is a relatively easy read that is perfect for revising challenging theoretical concepts in Machine Learning.</td>

            <td><b>Grokking Machine Learning</b> - Luis Serrano, Manning Publications</td>
            <td>This book is an excellent introduction into the world of Machine Learning - it uses very simple examples to explain different ML algorithms and Gradient Boosting. I believe that this is the best book that a person can choose to start their journey into the world of ML.<br>See my detailed review and error revision on <a href="https://github.com/EvgeniiZorin/Booknotes_Grokking-Machine-Learning_Luis-G-Serrano" target="_blank">Github</a></td>

        <tr>
            <td><b>Learning SQL</b> - Alan Beaulieu</td>
            <td>I liked this book as a revision resource for SQL. While well-written, I feel like it was lacking in the number of
            exercises. Additionally, it was using many subqueries instead of CTEs, which can require a skill to be able to write, 
            but in the real world CTEs make the code much more readable. Overall, pretty good book, but definitely not the best.</td>
            <td><img src="images\Learning-SQL-Alan-Beaulieu.jpg"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Data Analysis with Python</b> - freeCodeCamp</td>
            <td>This is a simple introductory course from FreeCodeCamp that teaches the essentials of data cleaning, processing, and visualisation with Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib).</td>
            <td><img src="images/freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python.png"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Scientific Computing with Python</b> - freeCodeCamp</td>
            <td>This course improved my understanding of programming in Python and offered some challenging certification projects.</td>

Apart from the resources mentioned above, I really enjoyed doing exercises on SQL on Leetcode. The problem set is called SQL 50 - you can check it out on my <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/vzem_19/" target="_blank">Leetcode profile</a>.

            <td>Following the completion of this code, I learned the essentials of relational databases (in this case, PostgreSQL), different ways to connect to the databases, and write scripts in Bash that would interact with PostgreSQL.</td>
